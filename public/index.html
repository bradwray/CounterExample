      The whole app renders into this div down below with the id of root! All the HTML 
      from all of the Components ends up building a "tree" of elements there
      It's called the DOM tree... (DOM = Document Object Model)
      they all have parent and child relationships like a hierarchy or family tree.
      This one is a small tree though.
      App is the root of that tree and Counter is its only child.
      Counter has three children, Container, Button and Count.
      It's a small family.
